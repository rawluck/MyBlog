description: "Most of the reasons we think we failed are lies."

The human brain has evolved a lot from primitive animals thousands of years ago who did whatever made them happy, but we don't live in that kind of world anymore but those instincts are still there.So what does the brain do when you fail and feel bad? It lies, it gives you excuses as to how it isn't your fault and its your friends, your parents, your colleagues, or even the society's fault.

We become deluded and we enjoy it, we like to live in a place where we don't have to take responsibility.I have seen it happen to me and to people I knew.We construct this world where nothings  our fault, but in reality 90% of what happens in your life is your own doing.

> ##So how do you stop this?
> ##Have a person that can call you out on your bullshit

<p>&nbsp;</p>

The easiest way to find if your excuses is bullshit or not is to tell someone and as a third person they can immediately tell if your reasoning is right or wrong.We can't do this to ourself because we are riddled with personal biases and can't look at the situation objectively. 

And when you try to find such a person, it will be hard.Not everyone is gonna do that for you, most of them like living in that lie and are content with it.You have to find people who are aware of it**and** want to improve their situation.

If you do this you will end with two kinds of people who are willing to criticize you, those who wanna help you and those who are criticizing you just to make themselves feel better.Here are two ways to find which one they are:-

- Whenever they criticize it will be upsetting because they are pointing out flaws, but it should make you sit and wallow in your misery

- Try some of the advices out see if they work if they don', they are probably not worth taking advice from.

Once you do it a few times you will realize the biggest problem stopping you from doing great things is you.
