description: A brief on how I got blog this up and running
---

This blog is made with gatsby its a static site framework which uses react for its templates.


I watched a single video on gatsby then downloaded a template I found to be good looking which was [lumen](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen).
Then proceeded to waste a lot of time because the structure didn't look familiar and me being me thought I didn't learn enough so I went to find another template
that could be easier to work with turns out there is another version the [lumen-v2](https://github.com/GatsbyCentral/gatsby-v2-starter-lumen) that is supposed to be used with the new version and I had been using the outdated version  
No wonder the code  looked so unfamiliar I was using the wrong version.

Then I used [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to deloy this.There is also a button in the lumen-v2's git repo and used the domain name to point at netlify's name servers by default they provide a "random_name".netlify.com as the address. 

So here it is the newer version working I still completely know the working that's why /books and /quotes don't have anything still working on getting that 
up and running.If is working  that means I actually figured it out.

Yeah turns out making a blog not that difficult when you use a pre-made template and don't know a bit of how it works.
