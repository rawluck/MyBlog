# You have a price

Do you think your integrity has price? A definitive number for which you will give up your integrity?

Try this thought experiment:-
You are an accountant for a large company where you can take money from the company without anyone knowing.

->Will you give up your integrity for $10?

->How about $100?

->What about a $1000?

Be honest with yourself and keep increasing that number you will reach a point where you will take the money over integrity.
That's the price of your integrity.
